# Risk-Aware-Planner

This repository contains my solution to the Wisconsin Autonomous Controls Coding Challenge, **"Risk Aware Planning."** The problem involves creating a path planning algorithm for a car to navigate to multiple destinations while considering a risk map and distance constraints.

## Challenge Summary

The objective of this challenge is to develop a path planning algorithm that finds the "best" path from a starting position to various destinations. The algorithm must:

-   **Avoid** "keep out" zones (risk value of 2).
-   **Minimize** accumulated risk from "high cost" zones.
-   Stay within a specified **maximum path length**.
-   Operate on an **8-connected grid**, with all path points as integers.
-   Adhere to all other rules outlined in the challenge description.

## My Approach: The A\* Search Algorithm

My solution utilizes the **A\* search algorithm**, which I chose for its efficiency and practicality in pathfinding. It combines the strengths of both greedy best-first search (by using a heuristic) and Dijkstra's algorithm (by considering the cost of the path so far).

I found this approach particularly fitting because a member of the club mentioned it was used in their self-driving car. This led me to believe it was a practical and appropriate method for this problem.

### Key Implementation Choices

-   **Heuristic:** I used the **Euclidean distance heuristic** for my `h` value. This is a common choice for grid-based pathfinding and works well with the diagonal step cost of $\sqrt{2}$.
-   **Step Costs:** To accommodate the 8-connected grid, I implemented step costs of **1** for horizontal and vertical movements and **$\sqrt{2}$** for diagonal movements.
-   **Risk Integration:** I incorporated a dynamic cost function into the A\* algorithm's `g` value. This function combines path length and risk, with adjustable weights to prioritize one over the other. The "keep out" zones are assigned an infinite cost to ensure the algorithm never enters them.
-   **Max Range:** The algorithm includes a check to ensure the path length does not exceed the `maximum_range` constraint.

## Issues and Workarounds

I encountered significant challenges with the provided files, particularly the **`.npy`** files for the map data. I was unable to open or view these files on my system, which prevented me from running the provided `test_planner.py` script and encountering the frequent "out of bounds" errors mentioned in my notes.

Due to this issue, I was unable to test my code on the actual challenge dataset. Instead, I created a custom, functional dataset within a separate file, `astar_demo.py`, to demonstrate that my A\* algorithm correctly handles all the required functionalities.

### **`astar_demo.py`**

This file is a standalone demonstration of my algorithm. It meets all the challenge requirements using a custom-built dataset that includes:
-   An 8x8 grid.
-   Defined "keep out" zones.
-   Specific "high cost" zones.
-   A set of "blocked nodes" to mimic obstacles.
-   A defined maximum range.

The purpose of this file is to show that my core path-planning logic is sound, despite the issues with the provided `.npy` files.

## Files Submitted

-   `path_planner.py`: My main code file containing the A* implementation.
-   `astar_demo.py`: A supplementary file demonstrating the algorithm's functionality.
-   `README.md`: This file, detailing my approach and thought process.
-   `results_fig.png`: A plot of the final paths (generated by the `test_planner.py` script on the provided starter code's invalid paths).
-   `results.yaml`: A YAML file of the results (generated from the invalid paths provided in the starter code).

**Note:** The `results_fig.png` and `results.yaml` files do not reflect the output of my `path_planner.py` solution due to the issues with the `.npy` files. They represent the output from the base `test_planner.py` script with its invalid paths.
