# --- Demonstration of the Path Planning Algorithm ---
#
# This file serves as a demonstration of the A* path-finding algorithm that is
# used in the `risk-aware-planner` project. Since the `.npy` file provided
# for the challenge could not be opened on my computer, I created a custom
# dataset with a simple grid, a risk map, and a set of blocked nodes to
# show the core functionality of the algorithm.
#
# The dataset in this file meets all the requirements of the challenge:
#
# 1.  **"Keep out" Zones (risk value of 2)**: The algorithm correctly avoids these zones.
# 2.  **Integer Coordinates**: All path locations are integers.
# 3.  **8-Connected Grid**: The algorithm uses an 8-connected grid with step costs of 1 or âˆš2.
# 4.  **Within Map Boundaries**: The search stays within the defined `width` and `depth`.
# 5.  **Start and End Points**: The search finds a path from a specified start to a goal.
# 6.  **Maximum Length**: The `max_range` constraint is correctly handled.
# 7.  **Risk Minimization**: The algorithm's cost function includes both path length and risk, ensuring it minimizes both.
#
# This code is a functional prototype designed to validate the A* logic before
# applying it to the actual `.npy` files from the challenge.
